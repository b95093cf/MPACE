Small HowTo.

You have to put your sidemission file into folder m for Sahrani.
The filename needs an index number, for example 12 for x_m12.sqf.

Add that index number to x_missionssetup.sqf in sm_array (#ifdef __DEFAULT__ for Sahrani)

Random sidemissions get picked if d_random_sm_array is set to true.
If set to false, the same order is used as specified in sm_array.

The mission file itself just needs the following:

1.
x_sm_pos
x_sm_type

x_sm_pos is an array with position arrays. First element (position) is the exact location of the sidemission.
(For convoy missions the first element (position) is the startpoint of the convoy, the second element (position) is the endpoint).

x_sm_type = "normal" for all normal missions, "convoy" for convoy missions.

Example:
x_sm_pos = [[14258.5,15169.1,0]]; // radar tower on Pico de Perez
x_sm_type = "normal"; // "convoy"

2.
#ifdef __SMMISSIONS_MARKER__
if (true) exitWith {};
#endif
You have to add that if you want to debug the sidemissions positions but it is optional.

3.
Add a text for the current mission in d_current_mission_text and a text for the resolved mission in d_current_mission_resolved_text.
Be sure that you add the if statement if (X_Client) then { around it.

Example:
if (X_Client) then {
	d_current_mission_text = "There is a radar tower on the top of mount Pico de Perez. Find it and destroy it.";
	d_current_mission_resolved_text = "Good job. The radar tower on top of mount Pico de Perez is down.";
};

4.
The buildup of the sidemission on the server. Units, vehicles, whatever you want. It's up to you.

Example:
if (isServer) then {
	__Poss
	_vehicle = "Land_radar" createvehicle (_poss);
	_vehicle setVectorUp [0,0,1];
	[_vehicle] spawn XCheckSMHardTarget;
	sleep 3.21;
	["specops", 1, "basic", 1, _poss,50,true] spawn XCreateInf;
	__AddToExtraVec(_vehicle)
};
Creates a small radar tower and a specops and normal infantry group.
Everything concerning the radio tower gets handled in XCheckSMHardTarget.

5.
To end a sidemission you have just to set the following variables...

d_side_mission_winner = 2;
and
d_side_mission_resolved = true;

If d_side_mission_resolved gets set to true the sidemission will end and that will get announced to the players.
So be sure to set the correct d_side_mission_winner ;)
In all normal version d_side_mission_winner is 2, so set d_side_mission_winner = 2; before you set d_side_mission_resolved to true.

There are some other values for d_side_mission_winner:

-1: The sidemission target died due to a tragic accident...
-2: The enemy decided to destroy the sidemission target by itself...
-300: The convoy reached its destination..."
-400: None or less than 8 prisoners made it back to base..."
-500: The enemy officer was killed..."
-600: The prototype was destroyed before it reached your base..."



Some special functions and macros for sidemissions:

XCreateInf:
	Example: ["specops", 1, "basic", 1, _poss,50,true] spawn XCreateInf;
	Will spawn one specops group and one normal infantry group.

	Parameters:
	1: can be "specops" or "basic"
	2: number of groups for first type
	3: can be "specops" or "basic"
	4: number of groups for second type
	5: position
	6: random radius where the groups will spawn
	7: true = groups will patrol, false = groups do not patrol
	   (patrol makes only sense if radius is >= 50)

XCreateArmor:
	Example: ["shilka", 1, "bmp", 1, "tank", 1, _pos_other,1,100,true] spawn XCreateArmor;
	Will spawn one AA group, one APC group and one tank group.

	Parameters:
	1: can be "shilka", "bmp", "tank", "brdm", "uaz_mg", "uaz_grenade"
	2: number of groups for first type
	3: can be "shilka", "bmp", "tank", "brdm", "uaz_mg", "uaz_grenade"
	4: number of groups for second type
	5: can be "shilka", "bmp", "tank", "brdm", "uaz_mg", "uaz_grenade"
	6: number of groups for third type
	7: position
	8: vehicles in group
	9: random radius where the groups will spawn
	10: true = groups will patrol, false = groups do not patrol
	    (patrol makes only sense if radius is >= 50)

XCheckSMHardTarget:
	Example: [_vehicle] spawn XCheckSMHardTarget;
	Will add the vehicle to the hard target handler.
	Means, it will add hit and damaged eventhandlers to the vehicle and remove it if player is within 20 m and
	it will add a killed eventhandler to end the sidemission if the vehicle (vehicle, building, whatever) gets destroyed
	(d_side_mission_winner = 2; and d_side_mission_resolved = true; get added automatically)

__AddToExtraVec(ddvec)
	Macro
	Will add ddvec to extra_mission_vehicle_remover_array which will remove all extra mission vehicles after the mission
	is finished. You have to include x_setup.sqf for that (#include "x_setup.sqf")
